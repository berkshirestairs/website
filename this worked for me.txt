The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:


 yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-gallery
  yarn start


  yarn global add serve
  serve -s build
